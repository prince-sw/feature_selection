## Introduction
In this project, we have performed performance analysis of fifteen feature selection methods by comparing 'accuracy' performance metric of each method over five classifciation algorithms.
We have used ten publically availabe datasets for this purpose.

### Feature Selection Methods Used:
1. Pair-wise Correlation
2. Regularized Self Representation
3. Variance Threshold
4. Logistic Regression based selection
5. Random Forest (Gini importance)
6. Boruta Algorithm
7. LASSO Algorithm
8. Extra Tree Classifier
9. Mutual Information Classifier
10. Chi-Square Test
11. Recursive Feature Elimination with RF
12. Correlation
13. Cosine Similarity and Standard deviation with Exponent
14. Laplacian Score
15. Iterative Laplacian Score

### Classification Algorithms Used:
1. Decision Trees
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. KNN
5. Naive Bayes

### Datasets Used:
1. Iris
2. Breast Cancer
3. Pima Indians Diabetes
4. Cirrhosis Prediction
5. Parkinson's Disease
6. Heart Disease
7. Sonar
8. Stroke Prediction
9. Wine Quality
10. Abalone
